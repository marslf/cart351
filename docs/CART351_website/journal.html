					<h4> WEEK 1: SEPTEMBER 8th </h4>
					<article>
						This class was just the intro class for this course. We talked about the tools we were
						going to use, different terminology and we did a review of what we had learned in previous
						classes. I am pretty happy to have Sabine again (not trying to flatter or anything, I am just
						being genuine 🙃)
					</article>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 2: SEPTEMBER 15th </h4>
					<article>
						This week was about networks and navigation. We installed Python and Miniconda, went
						surprisingly smoothly
						(some people had some difficulties). We learned a bunch of the basics, it was pretty
						straightforward, stuff like working with variables, statements, loops. It felt very familiar and
						easy because it was pretty similar to Javascript, which I have used a lot.
					</article>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 3: SEPTEMBER 22nd </h4>
					<article>
						I was unfortunetly sick this week and had to stay home, but I followed along the exercises using
						the moodle and class website. We continued using Python but this time with Web API's. I learned
						about dictionaries and getting values out of them and lists. There were some examples on how to
						fetch using requests. <article>
							We also had to complete exercise 1. The purpose of this was to practice recieving data from
							a
							WEB API, using the World Air Quality Index API. I made a small game where you have to guess
							which city has cleaner air between two options.
						</article>

					<h4> WEEK 4: SEPTEMBER 29th </h4>
					<article>
						This week, we were introduced Flask. We learned what it was and how to use it, starting with
						creating a flask environment. We learned how to create dynamic routes and templates which will
						be super useful in the futur. The example was pretty long and thurough and then the short
						exercise at the end of class allowed us to make sure we actually understood what we went over.
					</article>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 5: OCTOBER 6th </h4>
					<article>
						This week we went deeper into Flask. We learned about template inheritance, which lets you
						create a base template with
						shared elements like headers, footers, and nav bars, and then extend it for different pages. We
						practiced creating child
						templates from a base template and even tried multiple levels of inheritance. We also looked at
						filters in Jinja, which
						allow you to modify data directly in templates, and how to use the `url_for()` function to link
						templates and static
						files properly. Towards the end, we started working with HTML forms, learning the difference
						between GET and POST
						requests and how to handle form data in Flask. It was a lot, but it was cool to see how all
						these pieces fit together to
						make a more dynamic web app.
					</article>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 6: OCTOBER 20th </h4>
					<article>
						After the mid-term break, we started learning more about Flask. I followed along from home since
						I was sick.
						This week we learned more about Flask and how it connects Python with a web browser. It’s
						similar to PHP in the way
						templates work. We practiced using base.html to share headers or other common parts across
						pages, and render_template to
						load HTML and send variables. Exercise 2 was also due this week and we had to set up a Flask
						Application
						and work with the JINJA templating engine and use GET.
					</article>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 7: OCTOBER 27th </h4>
					<article> This week we kept working with Flask and learned how to handle forms and user input with
						GET and POST methods. We also
						learned about sessions, which let you store user data across pages without a database. I found
						it useful to see how
						websites can keep info temporarily. We also explored using Fetch API to send and receive data
						with JavaScript without
						reloading the page.
					</article>
				</section>

					<h4> WEEK 8: NOVEMBER 3rd </h4>
					<article> Week 8 was the first day of the STM strike, so I biked to class. It was a little chilly,
						but not too bad. In class, we
						continued with Flask and learned how to read from and write to text files and JSON files. We
						covered different file
						modes like read, write, append, and how to use functions like read(), readline(), writelines(),
						and write(). For JSON,
						we learned how to load and dump data, and how to append new data by reading and rewriting the
						file. <article>
							Also exercise 3 was due and we had to set up a flask app, use html templates and
							make something with some user interaction with POST and FETCH.
							I made a little constellation maker, it was fun.
						</article>

					<h4> WEEK 9: NOVEMBER 10th </h4>
					<article> This week we dove into Flask + MongoDB. MongoDB Atlas makes it super easy to have a cloud
						DB, and connecting from Flask
						felt smooth thanks to Flask-PyMongo. I set up my .env for credentials (security first!) and
						tested inserting documents.
						Then I built a simple plant gallery: insert, view, update, search, all working dynamically.
						Learned a lot about
						queries: filtering, sorting, limits, projections… MongoDB is way more flexible than I expected.
						Feeling good about
						handling DB interactions from Flask now. <article>
							Project 2 was due this week, mine is called Tiny Pond. It is a small, calming interactive
							world where users can create and name critters, frogs, tadpoles, fish, and bugs, and watch
							them move in a whimsical pond. Each critter has its own personality and movement, and all
							contributions are stored on
							the server, so the pond grows over time. A stats panel shows totals and activity, giving a
							sense of a shared, living
							space. The backend uses Flask and Python to save and load data, while HTML, CSS, and
							JavaScript render the pond and
							animate the critters dynamically. My goal was to make a meditative, playful experience that
							feels like a tiny pocket of
							summer warmth, even in the middle of winter.

					<h4> WEEK 10: NOVEMBER 17th </h4>
					<article> This week I explored WebSockets with Flask-SocketIO to make real-time, bi-directional
						connections between clients and
						the server. I set up a basic chat app where users enter a username, join the server, and can
						send messages that show up
						instantly for everyone. Then I integrated p5.js so users can draw flowers on a shared canvas,
						each click creates a flower
						locally and sends the data to all connected clients.<article>
							We also did exercise 4, we had to show the Project 2 we made to our peers and then
							reflect/comment on 3 projects that our peers made. I looked at Hurbert's, Sean's, and
							Michael's. They were all interesting and unique in their own way. I really liked the
							discussion.

					<h4> WEEK 11: NOVEMBER 24th </h4>
					<article> This week we did Exercise 5 with MongoDB. We practiced writing queries to filter and sort
						data by mood, event, day, and
						weather. The last part was making visualizations in JS for each query. I tried adding some
						animation and interactivity
						to make the data more fun to look at. It was cool seeing the survey data turn into moving
						patterns. </article>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4> WEEK 12: DECEMBER 1st </h4>
					<article> Michael and I took this period to discuss and plan our final project that we decided to
						team up for. We told each other the brainstorm during the previous week. I love finding inspo
						from random things in real life and when I was on my way to my philosophy exam I accidentally
						got off on the wrong floor, so I took the stair to get to the right floor and in the stairwell I
						found this really interesting mural which is the basis of our project. We also took inspo from
						webkins and club penguin. <article>In our project, called The Village, the user logs in and then
							creates
							a
							house which becomes a piece in the town above the ocean, like the mural I saw. The user will
							be
							able to play minigames to earn coins and then use those coins to customize their home. All
							the
							visuals will be made by me. I am really excited to work on this project. Michael and I split
							the
							workload during this class and then we left (I had to prepare for my presentation that I had
							in
							my next class). </article>
